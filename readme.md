<h2>User Instructions </h2>

When program begins, all tools are selectable (except point tool) <br/>
<p>
To begin drawing, select pen tip tool and click on canvas to see drawing. The drawing has been implemented to feature the "advanced drawing" feature, so the user can click on the control points while in drawing mode to edit the curve. <br>
To exit drawing mode, press ESC
</p> 
</br>
<p>
To enter Selection mode, press on the cursor icon. This will now disable the pen tip tool and eraser tool. To select a curve simply click on the desired curve, this should now allow the point tool and properties menu to be enabled and all segments and control points of the curve are now visable and moveable.<br/><br/>
The curve can be edited via moving the control points or the segment points, or selecting a colour, line thickness, or line type from the side toolbar<br/><br/>
While a curve is selected, the point tool becomes available, in which the user can switch between a smooth point or a sharp point. While the point tool has been selected all points clicked will be switched (you can still drag the control points). </br>
In order to exit the point tool, press ESC once, this will allow the user to continue editing the selected curve without changing the points. From here you can exit out of selection mode by pressing ESC again. 

If the user has only selected the cursor tool, then to exit requires pressing only ESC once. Basically if any edits have been made to the curve, this includes changing its point, colour, line thickness, and/or line type, ESC must be pressed twice to fully exit selection mode. 
</p>
</br>
<p>
the Eraser tool is enabled when no mode (i.e drawing or selecting) is currently being used. To use the Eraser Tool simply click the eraser and click the desired curve to remove. If in selection tool, selecting the curve and hitting DEL will also remove the curve.
